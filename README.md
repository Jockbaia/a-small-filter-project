### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This project is an attempt to apply techniques and concepts learnt in the Image Processing and Computer Vision course, aiming to implement something that the average smartphone user uses (almost) every day: filters. There are already hundreds, if not thousands, available on every social network, but there are also specific applications dedicated to applying very different, more or less complex filters. Our project, however, does not aim to provide filters that are better or more complex than those that already exist. Instead, we want to focus on what can be achieved after a basic course in image processing, with some in-depth studies that were necessary to achieve a satisfactory result. After a general explanation of the techniques, libraries and methods used, we will have a closer look at the individual filters.
